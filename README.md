Just a simple discord bot based on my class mate's behaviour.

To use this bot create a application at [Discord developer portal] (https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Once you created one you can rename renamemethis.json to config.json and put your token inside of the file.

To run the bot run the command "node index.js". You need to install nodejs to run the bot.
